Main nix configuration files

Run ~nix-develop~ in this directory then run ~rebuild~

# I WANNA USE THIS
okay thats nice, first you're gonna have to change a couple of things
- add a folder in the machines dir with hardware-configuration and a default.nix (or just a default.nix with the hardware config)
- add this host to the host lists in flake.nix
- change all the references from bezmuth to whatever username you wanna use (home dir n stuff)
